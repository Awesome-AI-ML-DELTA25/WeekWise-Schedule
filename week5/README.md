# Tasks in CV
This week we'll look at two of the most common tasks in computer vision: Object Detection + Localization and Segmentation.

## Object Detection + Localization
Detection and localization involve identifying objects within an image and determining their positions. This is often achieved using bounding boxes to enclose the detected objects.

## Segmentation
Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, often to simplify the representation of an image or make it more meaningful. This can be done at different levels, such as pixel-level segmentation (semantic segmentation) or instance-level segmentation.
