## Idea of ML
The idea of ML is to find a function that maps input features to output labels. The goal is to find a function that generalizes well to unseen data. This is done by minimizing the loss function, which measures the distance between the true function and the approximated function. Refer to [Idea of ML](./IdeaOfML.md) for more details.

## Decision Trees and XGBoost
Worked with Decision Trees, XGBoost and scikit-learn:
- Column Transformers: OneHotEncoder and StandardScaler
- Pipelines
- Test Train split
- Various metrics for regression and classification
- Model fitting
- Parameters vs Hyperparameters
- Feature importance
Refer to notebooks [Decision Trees](./DT.ipynb) and [XGBoost](./XGB.ipynb) for the content.
