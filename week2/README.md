## Idea of ML
The idea of ML is to find a function that maps input features to output labels. The goal is to find a function that generalizes well to unseen data. This is done by minimizing the loss function, which measures the distance between the true function and the approximated function. Refer to [Idea of ML](./IdeaOfML.md) for more details.
