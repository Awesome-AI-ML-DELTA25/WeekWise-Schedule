# Week 4 Content
## Intro to Computer Vision
Having explored tabular data, we now turn our attention to images. Images are a different type of data that require different techniques for analysis. In this week, we will learn about the basics of computer vision, including how to read and display images, and how to perform basic image processing tasks.

## Neural Networks don't need explicit features
In the previous weeks, we have learned about the importance of feature engineering in machine learning. However, in image data, there are generally no explicit features available. Neutal Networks allow us to use the pixel representation of an image to automatically extract features. In this week, we will explore how neural networks can learn to extract features from images without the need for explicit feature engineering.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that is specifically designed for image data. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. In this week, we will learn about the architecture of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. We will also explore how to implement CNNs using PyTorch.
